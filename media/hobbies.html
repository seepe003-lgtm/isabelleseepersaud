						<h3>Fostering Rescue Dogs</h3>
						<p>I volunteer with Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue of Minnesota, fostering dogs in need of temporary homes. This experience has taught me responsibility, compassion, and the importance of giving back to the community. I've helped socialize and care for dogs preparing for adoption, contributing over 100 volunteer hours to animal welfare.</p>
